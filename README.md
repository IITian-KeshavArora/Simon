# Description

The Simon Game is a classic electronic game that serves as a memory and pattern recognition challenge. Named after its inventor Ralph H. Baer's original name for the device, "Simon" has become synonymous with the game itself. It was first introduced in 1978 and quickly gained popularity for its simple yet engaging gameplay.

Gameplay Overview:
Objective:
The primary objective of the Simon Game is for players to repeat an increasingly longer sequence of lights and sounds generated by the device. The game continues until the player makes a mistake by failing to accurately reproduce the sequence.

# Components:

Four Colored Buttons:
The game typically features four colored buttons, each corresponding to a specific musical note or sound. These buttons are often colored red, blue, green, and yellow.
# Central Console:
The central console is the core of the game, featuring a speaker for audio output and a set of lights that correspond to each colored button.
# Game Sequence:

The game begins with a single button lighting up and emitting a sound.
The player must replicate this sequence by pressing the corresponding button.
After successfully reproducing the initial sequence, the game adds another step, making the sequence longer.
The player continues to repeat the increasingly complex sequences until an error occurs.
# Scoring:

Players are typically awarded points for each successfully repeated sequence.
The game may speed up as the player progresses, increasing the difficulty.
# Error Handling:

Making a mistake breaks the sequence, and the player might hear a distinct sound indicating the error.
Depending on the version of the Simon Game, players may get multiple chances or lives.
# Winning:

The game continues until the player makes an error or decides to stop.
The player's final score is determined by the number of correctly repeated sequences.
